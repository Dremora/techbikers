Hi {{ user.first_name }}

Great news - we'd love to have you as part of the TechBikers 2015 ride. Congratulations! We can't wait to ride with you and raise money for Room to Read.

To secure your place, please complete registration and pay your ride contribution by {{ registration.signup_expires|date:"d F" }}

If you haven't paid by then, we will release to the next batch, who might snap up your spot if you wait around.

To reiterate, the ride costs about £{{ ride.full_cost }} per rider. To help cover costs and get more money to Room to Read's aid projects, we're asking for a minimum contribution of £{{ ride.price }}.

You are very very welcome to pay more than that if you're able to, you absolute star.

In return, you get "stuff" worth well over £300, and that's excluding all of the ride planning, guiding, and networking you'll get in on!

What goes into the £300+? Here's an extract:

- Eurostar worth £80
- Bus ride in Paris worth £10
- Cycling jersey worth £50
- Hotel night 1 £30
- Hotel night 2 £30
- Lunch x3 £30
- Dinner x3 £30
- Channel ferry £35
- Boat ride on the Thames £15
- Closing party £10

Once you've confirmed your place, we'll follow up with more information very soon - all about how and where to set up your donations page, whether rental bikes are available (yes.), admin details etc.

Excited to ride with you!
