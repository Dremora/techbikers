Hi {{ user.first_name }}

Great news - we'd love to have you as part of the TechBikers {{ ride.name }} ride. Congratulations! We can't wait to ride with you and raise money for Room to Read.

To secure your place, please complete registration and pay your ride contribution by {{ invite_expires|date:"d F" }}.

If you haven't paid by then, we will release to the next batch, who might snap up your spot if you wait around.

To reiterate, the ride costs about {{ ride.full_cost }}{{ ride.currency }} per rider. To help cover costs and get more money to Room to Read's aid projects, we're asking for a minimum contribution of {{ ride.price }}{{ ride.currency }}.

Once you've confirmed your place, we'll follow up with more information very soon - all about how and where to set up your donations page, whether rental bikes are available (yes.), admin details etc.

Excited to ride with you!

Team TechBikers
