          <h2>The 2014 Ride</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Our 2014 ride again sets new standards for us. At 430km in three days it is longer that any route we have attempted so far. But do not worry: the terrain is largely flat, making for comfortable and speedy cycling. We start Thursday 24th of July, and arrive in Berlin on Sunday the 27th July in the evening.</p>
    <h1 dir="ltr">LOGISTICS</h1>
    <h3 dir="ltr">Day 0 – Thursday</h3>
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Berlin to Copenhagen</strong></p>
    <p dir="ltr">All TechBikers will meet in Berlin at Admiralspalast on Thursday 24th of July, around noon. From here we’ll take the TechBikers bus to Copehagen, where we have the first networking opportunity and time to get prepared for the ride.</p>
    <h3 dir="ltr">Day 1 – Friday</h3>
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Copehagen to Nykobing Falster</strong> – 145 km</p>
    <p dir="ltr">The ride kicks off from the modern <a href="https://www.wakeupcopenhagen.com/" target="_blank">WakeUp hotel in Copenhagen</a>, near the Tivoli Gardens and Christiansborg Palace. We will mainly follow minor main roads and country roads out of Copenhagen, heading south and following the coast. From there we will take a&nbsp;circuitous route into the peaceful Danish countryside, and finally cross the Storstrøm into Falster Island via a causeway bridge. The perfect spot for a quick rest and photos! At the end of the day, we will stay in <a href="http://www.hotel-falster.dk/" target="_blank">Hotel Falster</a> for our well deserved dinner and drinks.</p>
    <h3 dir="ltr">Day 2 – Saturday</h3>
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Nykobing Falster to Klink on Lake Müritz</strong> -&nbsp;135km</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Saturday will start early, with the first 25km on Falster Island towards the ferry port of Gedser, where we will catch the 9 am ferry to Rostock. Arriving at 11 am, we will cycle to the town of Laage to have lunch. The quiet countryside will lead us into a beautiful area of many lakes, where we will stay in Klink on the shore of Lake Müritz. Our hotel will be the <a href="http://www.mueritz-hotel.de/" target="_blank">Müritz Hotel</a>, with the Müritz National Park just around the corner.</p>
    <h3 dir="ltr">Day 3 –Sunday</h3>
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Lake Müritz to Berlin</strong> – 150km</p>
    <p>Our most demanding day, which again warrants an early start. We will briskly cycle along good country roads and traffic free cycling roads following parts of the popular Copenhagen – Berlin Cycle Route. Through the Müritz National Park – a land of forests, lakes and wildlife – we will pass the delightful small towns of Wesenberg, Fürstenberg, Zehdenick, Liebenwalde, and Summt, before crossing the Berlin Ring Road into Greater Berlin. We have found a fairly countrified route through North Berlin suburbs except for the last 10km to the Brandenburg Gate.</p>
